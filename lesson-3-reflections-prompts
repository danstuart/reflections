When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

For others to access and share, and to access from other machines.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

You can choose when to update at milestones and once you are finished making all changes.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Forks creates a new version of the repository, close is a new version but linked to the original and a branch is a temporary version for editing.
